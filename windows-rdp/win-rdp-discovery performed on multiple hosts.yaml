title: RDP discovery performed on multiple hosts
name: rdp_discovery_multiple_host
description: Detects scenarios where an attacker attempts to discover active RDP services via tools like Hydra. Note that this event doesn't provide any information about login outcome (success or failure) as well as user information. For further correlation, ID 4624/4625 (logon type 3, 7 or 10) as well as ID 1149 should be used.
