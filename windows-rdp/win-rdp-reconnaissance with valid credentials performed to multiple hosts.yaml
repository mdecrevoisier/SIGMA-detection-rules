title: RDP reconnaissance with valid credentials performed on multiple hosts
name: rdp_reconnaissance_valid_cred
description: Detects scenarios where an attacker attempts to brutforce RDP services with compromised credentials via tools like Hydra. Note that this event will be reported only with valid user and password credentials, and it may be reported only when RDP session is fully opened (so not during reconnaisance phase) if NLA is disabled. For further correlation, ID 4624/4625 (logon type 3, 7 or 10) should be used.
